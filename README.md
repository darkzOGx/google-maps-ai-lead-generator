## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Proxy Settings (Auto-Selection)

```json
{
  "proxy": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": []
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- **Empty array = Auto-selection** (Recommended) - Apify automatically uses the best available proxies from your plan
- **Works with all tiers** - Free (datacenter), Starter (datacenter), Pro (datacenter + residential)
- **Adaptive performance** - Actor automatically adjusts timeouts/concurrency based on proxy availability
- **No manual configuration needed** - Just enable `useApifyProxy: true`

**Advanced proxy options:**
```json
{
  "proxy": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": ["RESIDENTIAL"],  // Specify if you want residential only
    "countryCode": "US"  // Optional: Target specific country
  }
}
```

### Performance Settings

The actor **automatically optimizes** concurrency and timeouts based on your proxy configuration:

**With proxies (datacenter or residential):**
- Browser concurrency: 2 browsers
- Navigation timeout: 30 seconds
- Handler timeout: 45 seconds
- Retries: 2 attempts

**Without proxies (slower but free):**
- Browser concurrency: 1 browser
- Navigation timeout: 45 seconds
- Handler timeout: 60 seconds
- Retries: 3 attempts

**Manual override (not recommended):**
```json
{
  "maxConcurrency": 5
}
```
Higher = faster but uses more compute units and may cause memory issues.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & FAQs

### ❓ No results found / Very few results
**Solution:**
- Try broader search terms ("restaurants" instead of "italian restaurants with outdoor seating")
- Increase `maxResults` parameter to 500+
- Remove strict filters (set `minRating: 0`, `minReviews: 0`)
- Try different location formats ("San Francisco" vs "San Francisco, CA" vs "SF Bay Area")

### ❓ No emails found (0% extraction)
**Check these settings:**
- ✅ Ensure `enrichment.extractEmails: true` is enabled
- ✅ Set `filters.hasWebsite: true` (can't extract emails without websites)
- ✅ Disable `fastMode` (fast mode skips detail pages where websites are found)
- ⚠️ Some industries have low website adoption (e.g., restaurants, retail)

### ❓ Actor runs out of memory or times out
**Solution:**
- Set `maxConcurrency: 2` or lower (default is 5, which may be too high)
- Reduce `maxResults` per query (try 250-500 instead of 1000+)
- Split large searches into multiple smaller runs
- Disable reviews extraction if not needed (`extractReviews: false`)

### ❓ All leads scored as "F" grade
**Likely cause:** Your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) doesn't match the scraped businesses
**Solution:**
- Check `scoring.idealCustomerProfile.industries` matches the categories you're scraping
- Adjust industry and location weights to better match your target market
- Use the score breakdown to understand why leads scored low

### ❓ Proxy errors (SHADER, DATACENTER, RESIDENTIAL)
**Solution:**
- Set `proxy.apifyProxyGroups: []` (empty array) for auto-selection
- Don't specify proxy group names unless you know your plan has them
- Actor will automatically use the best available proxies from your Apify plan

### ❓ Slow performance / Taking too long
**Solution:**
- Enable `fastMode: true` for 10x faster scraping (basic data only)
- Disable email extraction if not needed
- Use datacenter proxies instead of residential (faster, cheaper)
- Check you have enough compute units (actor pauses if account depleted)
